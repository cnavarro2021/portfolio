  <h3 class="description" <p>When you apply to colleges, they have an admissions rate, which tells you if you have a good chance in getiing into school. For example, Stanford has a 5% percent admissions rate, which means that out of all 100 students who are awaiting their decision, 5 people only get in. An example of a school with a high admissions rate is UNLV, which may accept anyone because it has less application requirements. </p>

  <p class="information"> When it comes to applying for colleges, you got to watch out for your financial aid package because it tells you what is your net price and sticker price. The net price is the cost of tuition at college, but the sticker price is the real price you are paying for college. It might come up with work-study, which is you work at a college to provide for your tuition, but it can be optional for you. You can potentially earn a full-ride scholarship; you will not pay any single penny for your tuition at a university. Colleges can provide scholarships you can apply for for extra money, but the biggest tip is to not panick about the cost of college because it might cost a lot, but you can go to college because it might be cheaper than it seems.

     <p class="budget"> The next thing you have to consider when you go to college is making a budget and how much income of money you have. One good tip to save money and not overspend it, so you don't go into debt is understanding what you need and what you want. Needs are things that you need in life every day, but wants are things that you might want to have, but you don't need it. Examples of needs is food, shelter, clothes that are cheap, books/supplies, and etc. Examples of wants is video games, Iphone X, Spotify Premium, Nintendo SWitch, and others. </p>
